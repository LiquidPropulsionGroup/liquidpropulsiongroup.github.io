  content: Our mission is to design, manufacture, and test fire liquid rocket engine systems. Our first project--Stinger--is a 1kN (250lbf) thrust kerosene and liquid oxygen pressure fed engine that we plan to test fire in November. We have many exciting projects planned after Stinger including an autogenously pressurized methane/liquid oxygen engine, an IREC-style sounding rocket, and a propulsively landing hopper.
