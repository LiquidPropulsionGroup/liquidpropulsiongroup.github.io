- title: Our Mission
  content: Our mission is to design, manufacture, and test fire liquid rocket engine systems. Our first project--Stinger--is a 1kN (250lbf) thrust kerosene and liquid oxygen pressure fed engine that we plan to test fire in November. We have many exciting projects planned after Stinger including an autogenously pressurized methane/liquid oxygen engine, an IREC-style sounding rocket, and a propulsively landing hopper.

- title: History
  content: The Liquid Propulsion Group was founded in January 2020. The organization moved to mostly remote in March and we have been developing a streamlined remote workflow ever since. We held our first Concept Design Review with industry advisors in July, and we are quickly approaching our first static fire milestone.
