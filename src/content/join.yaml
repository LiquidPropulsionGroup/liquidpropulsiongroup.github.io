- title: What can you expect?
  content: "The project is roughly split into subsystems but our members are not required to solely specialize into just one subteam. The subteams are Engine, Propellant System, and Controls. Here are some things you will be able to work on and learn about in the project.\n
    - Top-down CAD design of a fluid and mechanical system using Solidworks and Siemens NX.\n
    - Stress, thermal, and fluid analysis using analytical and finite element methods. (NX and ANSYS)\n
    - Custom design code for rocket engine sizing utilizing supersonic flow and heat transfer fundamentals. (Python and MATLAB)\n
    - Tolerance stackup and analysis, GD&T, and design for manufacturing of entire rocket engine. Fabrication of rocket engine parts. Requirements-based validation of fabricated parts.\n
    - Pressure system design with electronic and mechanical safeties and redundancy.\n
    - Instrumentation and metrology of a fluid-mechanical system.\n
    - Safe engine static-fire procedure development and design of test stand.\n
    - Build out an embedded control system to safely operate a rocket engine test stand and collect data. (Rust, Circuit Python, Arduino, I2C)\n
    - Develop a webserver to control the system and serve a UI to human operator. (REST, Node.JS, etc.)\n
    - And more! Define engineering goals, plan requirements, research literature, and create novel designs!\n"
